#Commands for importing json files into a mongo db

mongoimport -d test -c shops appleTest.json

-d is followed by the database you want to push it to
-c is followed by the collection within that database that you want to push the stuff into
then you have the name of the json file you want to push




#Querying MongoDB database

db.shops.find({},{id:1})
The first {} is where you put restrictions on what you want from a certain field.  Like id > 500 could go there
The second {} lets you select which columns you are querying for. id:1 means you will get the id field back.  You can also just exclude certain one by saying id:0

db.collection.remove()

Examples:

To find tweets about specific stock ticker use the following:
	
	db.StockTwits2010.find({"symbols": {$elemMatch:{symbol:"ES_F"}}})
